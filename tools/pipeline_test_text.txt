### Chapter 1 - Irina

IRINA'S POV

***"You******are******no******child******of******mine\!"***

I abruptly woken up by my father's loud voice in my dreams. I looked around the moving car and sighed heavily. "We're not there yet?" The female driver looked back to me using the reared view mirror. "No Miss. 10 more minutes." I sighed again and looked out of the windows. 

My name is Irina Audra, the daughter of Larion Audra, the chairman of the world's leading secret association for assassins. I was raised in a very dark situation where I'm constantly looking up to death. After the death of my older brother and sisters because of my own foolishness, my father chased me out and disowned me as his daughter. 

I am now just Irina. I sighed when I saw the vast building of the place I call home. It's a complete change from my old environment but, my mom are the only person who I can count on. "Madam Dasha will be very please miss. She's always been telling us the staff about you and your other siblings. And of course, my condolences for their passing." 

"Staff? Is that mean your an assassin as well" she shake her head. "No ma'am. I'm just one of the people who created the weapons used by the student." It gained my attention. "You made guns?" She nodded. "Blades, axe, bows, you named it. I am also a part time driver." She smiled and entered the huge gated community.
